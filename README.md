# Zabbix Map Creation Automation (GLPI database)

This project creates maps in Zabbix based on a GLPI database. Note that there are some tables created by the GLPI plugin called "fields". This plugin creates blocks of custom fields.

Currently, the project is focused on a specific area. The future goal is for it to be modified to cover other topologies.
